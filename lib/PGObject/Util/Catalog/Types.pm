=head1 NAME

PGObject::Util::Catalog::Types - Utilities for working with Composite types

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02';



=head1 SYNOPSIS

To get the attributes of a composite type:

   use PGObject::Util::Catalog::Types;
   my $dbh = DBI->connect(...);
   my @attributes = get_attributes(
          typename => 'foo', 
        typeschema => 'public',
               dbh => $dbh);

=head1 OPTIONALLY EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

=over

=item get_attributes

=back

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 get_attributes

This takes a list of args as a hash and returns a list of hashrefs, one for 
each attribute in order.  This function may be memoized, so it is not safe to
alter any part of the returned data structure in any way.

Arguments are:

=over

=item typename

Name of type

=item typeschema

Schema to look in.  This is required

=item dbh

Database handle to use.  This allows different dbs to be used simultaneously 
with different type definitions.

=back

Each hashref includes the following fields:

=over

=item attname 

The attribute name

=item atttype

The name of the type

=back

=cut

sub get_attributes {
    my %args = @_;
    croak 'No DB Handle Provided' unless $args{dbh};
    croak 'No schema provided' unless $args{typeschema};

    my $query = "
       SELECT attname, typname as atttype
         FROM pg_attribute a
         JOIN pg_class r ON a.attrelid = r.oid
         JOIN pg_type t ON t.oid = a.atttypid
         JOIN pg_namespace n ON r.relnamespace = n.oid
        WHERE relname = ? AND nspname = ? and attnum > 0
     ORDER BY a.attnum
     ";
     my $sth = $args{dbh}->prepare($query);
     $sth->execute($args{typename}, $args{typeschema});
     my @cols;
     while (my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref('NAME_lc')){
         push @cols, $ref;
     }
     return grep {defined $_->{attname}} @cols;
}
